Handler :- is a task that runs only when another task change the managed Host

*] Ansible modules are designed to be idempotent. This means that if you run a playbook multiple times, the result is always the same.

*] Modules Runs to make Desired State equal to Actual State

*] However, sometimes when a task does make a change to the system, a further task might need to be run.
   For example, a change to a service's configuration file might then require that the service be reloaded so that the changed configuration takes effect.

   Handlers are tasks that respond to a notification triggered by other tasks.
   Tasks only notify their handlers when the task changes something on a managed host.
   Each handler is triggered by its name after the play's block of tasks.
