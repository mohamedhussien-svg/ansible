*] You need to configure

    Users
    Groups
    Configure SSH [Generate user SSH keys , Manage the known_hosts, Manage the authorized_key]
    Modify Sudo Configuration in the Host

1] Manage Users [ansible.builtin.user]

    the module [ansible.builtin.user] is responsible for configure Linux Users
    so you can create, modify or remove users in managed hosts

    you can assign user to group , modify
        user shell
        user home dir
        user groups
        user password

    also you can use this module configure user ssh

2] Manage Groups [ansible.builtin.Groups]

    you can manage linux group using this module to do :
        Create
        Remove
        Modify
    Groups

3] Manage The Known Hosts Files [ansible.builtin.known_hosts]

    so you can manage ssh host key in the managed host by adding or remove them from the known_hosts file
    so you will not need to specify the password to making ssh connection

    key: is the public key of the server

4] The Authorized Key Module
    The ansible.posix.authorized_key module manages SSH authorized keys for user accounts on managed hosts.

    The following example demonstrates how to use the ansible.posix.authorized_key module to add an SSH key to a managed host:

    - name: Set authorized key
      ansible.posix.authorized_key:
        user: user1 1
        state: present 2
        key: "{{ lookup('ansible.builtin.file', 'files/user1/id_rsa.pub') }}" 3

5] Configuring Sudo Access for Users and Groups
    In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9, you can configure access for a user or group to run sudo commands without requiring a password prompt.

    The following example demonstrates how to use the ansible.builtin.lineinfile module to provide a group with sudo access to the root account without prompting the group members for a password:

    - name: Modify sudo to allow the group01 group sudo without a password
      ansible.builtin.lineinfile:
        path: /etc/sudoers.d/group01
        state: present
        create: true
        mode: 0440
        line: "%group01 ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL" 5
        validate: /usr/sbin/visudo -cf %s
