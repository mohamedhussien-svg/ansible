*] Manage large playbooks by importing or including other playbooks or tasks from external files,
   either unconditionally or based on a conditional test.

 *] you can include files or import files
    When you include content, it is a dynamic operation. Ansible processes included content during the run of the playbook, as content is reached.
    When you import content, it is a static operation. Ansible preprocesses imported content when the playbook is initially parsed, before the run starts.

    import_playbook:- should be at the top of playbook
