1] Troubleshooting Connection Issue

    You may use wrong remote_user in ansible.cfg file
    you may not set or establish the ssh keys connection

2] Problem in resolving Host name or address

    you can use host_ansible variable to specify name or address for the managed host in th inventory but this make issue if you add wrong name

    servera.lab.example.com     host_ansible=servera

3] Problem in privilege Escalation

    we use the remote_user to connection to the host
    and if you need to run a playbook with user that has higher privilege you can you become_user
    and make user that sudo is configured to use with thi user without password
    become_user is root be default

4] Problem in python in the managed host

   as ansible used python to run the ansible modules and playbook
   you need to check that a suitable python interpreter is installed in the  managed hosts

5] Try using check mode --check

    You can run the ansible playbook in check mode that make smoke test for the playbook without making any changes

    ansible-navigator run -m stdout playbook.yml --check --diff

    you can force a task to run in check mode using
    check_mode: true

6] Testing using test modules

    some modules can give you information about the managed hosts , and this information can be used in debug or test

        1] ansible.builtin.uri
        2] ansible.builtin.script
        3] ansible.builtin.command
        4] ansible.builtin.stat
        5] ansible.builtin.assert


7] Testing using ad hoc command

    is the way to run ansible task quickly and this used for troubleshooting the managed hosts
    like ping 0r run command

    ansible servera.lab.example.com -m ansible.builtin.ping
    ansible servera.lab.example.com -m ansible.builtin.command -a 'df'
    ansible servera.lab.example.com -m ansible.builtin.command -a 'free -m'
    ansible webservers -u devops -b  -m command -a 'systemctl status httpd
