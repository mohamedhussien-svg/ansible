Ansible facts are variables that are automatically discovered by Ansible on a managed host. Facts contain host-specific information that can be used just like regular variables in plays, conditionals, loops, or any other statement that depends on a value collected from a managed host.

Some facts gathered for a managed host might include:

The host name

The kernel version

Network interface names

Network interface IP addresses

Operating system version

Number of CPUs

Available or free memory

Size and free space of storage devices

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Your play might restart a server by using a conditional task based on the value of a fact that was gathered, such as the status of a particular service.

The play might customize a MySQL configuration file depending on the available memory that is reported by a fact.

The IPv4 address used in a configuration file might be set based on the value of a fact.

Even if gather_facts: false is set for a play, you can manually gather facts at any time by running a task that uses the ansible.builtin.setup module:
